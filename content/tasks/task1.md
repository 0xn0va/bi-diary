I worked in different jobs and positions during time and had to work with differernt types of managers and leaders a good leader that help to improve the company and team make the working environment good and stable.

The ability to be able to work as a team member and help each other and get help is not a thing that everyone has it but everyone can develop it, its one of the most important trade that can make a project successfull because not only one person cant do everything and with a good team and plan and management everything can be done in time.

The good thing in our time is that there are a lot of different good methodologies and tools out there that we can use for out teamwork like Agile methodology and trello and etc.
