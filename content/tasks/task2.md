### Google Marketing
I googled "mobile application development"  and "computer security service" and in the results we can see several companies shows up with the "Ad" tag that advertised their website to show as first results in google search. 

We can name Ciklum, Oracle, iflexion, Tieto that payed for special position but we can say almost all good enterprises that are showing up in first few pages on google did some google marketing and search engine optimization (SEO) 

google gives web admin a set of tools like Adwords and statistics and web admin panel to manage the whole SEO campaign and advertisement campaign with all these tools a web admin can monitor and modify the website look and position in google searches and its ads on different other websites and youtube.
