### Visiting Business Kitchen

As they defined themselves in business kitchen website they are Oulu universitiesâ€™ entrepreneurship hub, a community and co-working space to boost action and discover new opportunities in business and in life. 

Last year they were placed in city center but this year they moved to OAMK Kotkantie campus.

They hold different kind of events connecting people and businesses together and helping them grows and learn events for kickstarting and for startups like startup weekend Avanto and Demola, polar bear pitching and etc.

I also attended to startup weekend last autumn and it was one of my best experiences.
